Welcome to **Flowstry**! "Flowstry" refers to the open-source project and its maintainers. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Flowstry application and services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 2. User Content & License
1. **Ownership:** You retain all rights and ownership of the diagrams, workspaces, and other content you create ("User Content").
2. **License:** You grant Flowstry a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works (such as thumbnails) of your User Content *solely for the purpose of operating, promoting, and improving the Service*.
