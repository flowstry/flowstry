## 1. Information We Collect

We collect personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register for an account or choose to participate in various activities related to the Application. Data we collect includes:
- **Identity Data:** Name, Google ID (if using Google Auth).

### C. Workspace & Diagram Content
We store the content you create, such as workspaces and diagrams.
- **Unencrypted Content:** By default, content is stored securely on our servers. We do not access this content except as necessary to provide the service (e.g., storage, backup).
- **Encrypted Content:** If you utilize our "End-to-End Encryption" feature, your workspace and diagram content is encrypted on your device *before* it is sent to our servers. We do not possess the decryption keys and **cannot** access or view this content.

- Create and manage your account.
- Facilitate the creation and editing of diagrams.
- Send you administrative information, such as updates, security alerts, and support messages.

## 3. GDPR Compliance (General Data Protection Regulation)
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights from the GDPR. Flowstry aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Data.

**Your Rights:**
- **The right to access:** You have the right to request copies of your personal data.
- **The right to rectification:** You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate.
- **The right to erasure:** You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.

## 4. Encryption & Data Security
We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption:** For workspaces where encryption is enabled, we utilize client-side encryption. The decryption key is derived from a password known only to you. **We do not store this password.** If you lose this password, we cannot recover your data.

## 5. Third-Party Service Providers
We may share information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including data hosting (Google Cloud Platform) and authentication (Google Auth).
